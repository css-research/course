# Methods and Initial Results

### Write the data/methods sections for your research paper and present your initial results.

* 4-8+ pages (maybe more depending on how extensively you have analyzed your data so far)
* Include the major components of these sections as covered earlier this term. In no particular order (but follow an order that makes sense for your paper):
    * Define the model (but don't reproduce the literature review - you'll link these together in the final paper)
    * Describe the data and how to obtain it
    * Describe data collection procedures
    * Map variables to theoretical constructs
    * Summary statistics for key variables
    * Define the methods used to analyze the data
    * Present initial (tentative results)
    * Use tables and figures as appropriate
* Grading will be based on:
    * Actually having data to analyze (and being appropriate for your theory)
    * Implementing an appropriate computational method given your research question
    * Describing your data using appropriate methods
    * Presenting and explaining results accurately and clearly
    * Tables and figures are not raw output from Python/R, but are properly formatted and labeled
* A PDF of this document should be available in the `MethodsResults` folder in your repo by **11:59pm on Wednesday, May 22nd**
