# Project Proposal (10 points)

**Generate a research project topic using a computational social science research design**

## Elements of a project proposal

1. Clearly state a research question
    * Maybe give a few citations (not a full literature review)
    * Give a little information about why it is interesting
    * Give a little information about what your contribution will be
1. Describe how you will answer that question
    * What data will you use?
        * Give a good figure/plot/table
    * What theory will you use to interpret the data?
    * What analyses and computational tools will you use?

## Proposal format

1. 2-3 pages double-spaced
1. Push your proposal to your project repository on GitHub in the `Proposal` folder no later than 11:59pm, Wednesday, April 10

## Things to watch out for

* State your research question clearly
    * Usually a narrower scope is better
    * Title should refer to a question
* Make sure to use a computationally-enhanced research design
    * This could involve computational elements for data collection or statistical learning methods
    * This could involve running a digital survey or experiment or simulation
    * What you should not prepare - a basic OLS/logistic regression model reevaluating a commonly used observational data set. Do something more challenging!
* **Make sure you can get the data**
