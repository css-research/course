# MACS 30200 - Perspectives on Computational Research (Spring 2019)

* Instructor: [Benjamin Soltoff](http://www.bensoltoff.com), Lecturer in [Computational Social Science](http://macss.uchicago.edu)
* Meeting day/time: MW 11:30-1:20pm (Saieh Hall of Economics 247)
* Office hours: Th 12:30-2:30pm (McGiffert House 209)

## Course description

This course focuses on applying computational methods to conducting social scientific research through a student-developed research project. Students will identify a research question of their own interest that involves a direct reference to social scientific theory, use of data, and a significant computational component. The students will collect data, develop, apply, and interpret statistical learning models, and generate a fully reproducible research paper. We will identify how computational methods can be used throughout the research process, from data collection and tidying, to exploration, visualization and modeling, to the final communication of results. The course will include modules on theoretical and practical considerations, including topics such as epistemological questions about research design, writing and critiquing papers, and additional computational tools for analysis.

* All assignments related to the final project will be turned in via their own public GitHub repositories. You can create this repository [here](https://classroom.github.com/a/QnC7JReS). The directory structure of this repository should contain **at minimum** the following directories:
    * `Proposal`
    * `LitReview`
    * `MethodsResults`
    * `Poster`
    * `FinalPaper`
* Each problem set will be submitted via pull request to individual repositories (e.g. `hw01`, `hw02`, `hw03`)

## Late Problem Sets

Late problem sets will be penalized 1 point for every hour they are late. For example, if an assignment is due on Monday at 11:30am, the following points will be deducted based on the time stamp of the last commit.

| Example PR last commit | Points deducted |
| ---------------------- | --------------- |
| 11:31am to 12:30pm     | -1 point       |
| 12:31pm to 1:30pm       | -2 points       |
| 1:31pm to 2:30pm       | -3 points       |
| 2:31pm to 3:30pm       | -4 points       |
| 9:30pm and beyond      | -10 points (no credit) |
